        #set of front-and-back wheels on a 4-wheel robot) with +X towards the
        #right and +Y towards the front (body coordinates). The center of the

        #is directly to the side of the back wheel, and therefore on the 
        #x-axis (y=mx+b,m=0,b=0). Also, the center of curvature is on the line
        #perpendicular to the steering wheels. This is on the line y=mx+b,
